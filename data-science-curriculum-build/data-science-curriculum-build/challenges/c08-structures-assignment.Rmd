*Purpose*: Most real problems have multiple sources of uncertainty mixed together. Untangling these different sources can be challenging, even on a conceptual level. In this challenge we'll study a simple problem of structural safety, and use this small case study to untangle sources of sampling and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

*Note*: In this challenge I provide a lot of stub-code; you won't have to do too much coding. This is because I want you to *focus on answering the conceptual questions*. The most important questions in this challenge are: *What sources of uncertainty are you accounting for? What sources are you not accounting for? Are those sources real or induced?*

See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true) for more information.

# Setup
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

```{r setup}
library(MASS)
library(rsample)
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
filename_samples <- "./data/al_samples.csv"

```

*Background*: The [strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength) of a material is the amount of mechanical stress it can survive before breaking. To illustrate: Stresses are internal forces that hold an object together when we try to squeeze, stretch, or otherwise deform a solid object. For instance, if we pull on a rectangular bar of material, internal stresses $\sigma$ work to keep the bar together.

*Strength* is a measure of how much internal stress an object can survive: A higher strength means a stronger material. This challenge's data are very simple: They are (synthetic) observations of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) on individual samples of the same aluminum alloy. The experiments were carried out following the higest standards of experimental rigor, so you should consider these values to be the "true" breaking strength for each sample.

```{r read-data}
## NOTE: No need to edit; load data
df_samples <- read_csv(filename_samples)
df_samples
```
Data Dictionary:

| Quantity       | Units |
|----------------|-------|
| Strength (UTS) | psi   |

### __q1__ Visualize the strength data with a histogram. Answer the questions below.

```{r q1-task}
ggplot(df_samples, aes(x=strength)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200) +
  xlab("Strength (UTS) [psi]") + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  ggtitle("UTS Distribution")
```

**Observations**:

- What is the mean strength of the material, approximately?
  - The mean strength of the material is roughly between 39800 and 40000 psi.
- To what extent can you tell what shape the distribution of the data has?
  - It looks roughly like a roughly lognormal distribution on my graph. However, due to the low sample size I have, the distribution should be taken with a grain of salt and more accurate distribution can be attained with a larger sample size.
- Assuming the scopus is the strength of an individual part made from this aluminum alloy, is the observed variability real or induced?
  - The observed variability is real because there is no simulation involved and all variablilities come from a real variation/reading variation.

# Assessing Structural Safety
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

*Objective*: In this challenge you are going to study a structure and assess its *probability of failure* (POF). A higher POF corresponds to a more unsafe structure. Ultimately, we want

$$\text{POF} < 0.03.$$

Your job is to assess a given structure using the data provided and determine whether you can *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`.

## Structural model
<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

The following code chunk sets up a structural model: We are considering a rectangular bar under uniaxial tensile load (as pictured above). A larger cross-sectional area `A` is capable of surviving a greater load `L`, but a larger `A` is a heavier (more expensive) structure. The internal stress is approximately `sigma = L / A`---we simply compare this quantity against the strength.

I pick particular values for `A, L` and package all the information in the *limit state function* `g_break`:

```{r model-setup}
## NOTE: No need to edit; model setup
A <- 0.0255 # Cross-sectional area
L <- 1000 # Applied load (lbs)

g_break <- function(strength) {
  strength - L / A
}
```

The *probability of failure* (POF) is then defined in terms of the limit state $g$ via:

$$\text{POF} \equiv \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0].$$

### __q2__ Using the observations in `df_samples` and the structural model `g_break()`, estimate the probability of failure.

*Hint*: In `c07-monte-carlo` you learned how to estimate a probability as the `mean()` of an indicator. Use the same strategy here.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure; i.e. POF = Pr[g <= 0]
set.seed(123)
n_sim <- 100000
samples <- rnorm(n_sim, mean = mean(df_samples$strength), sd = sd(df_samples$strength)) 
indicator <- as.numeric(g_break(samples) <= 0) 
pof <- mean(indicator)

pof # print the estimated POF
```

**Observations**:

- Does this estimate satisfy `POF < 0.03`?
  - Yes, the POF is predicted to be 0.02132, which is smaller than 0.03
- Is this estimate of the probability of failure trustworthy? Why or why not?
  - The estimate of POF is reasonably trustworthy, although there are a few limitations and assumptions in the method. For example, the estimate assumes that the distribution of strength is normal, which may not be a valid assumption depending on the source of the data. 
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not.
  - I am fairly confident in the POF < 0.03, however, since our base data is from a set of 25 samples, the distribution pattern could be induced. This makes me less confident in the data. 

## Material property model
<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Since we have so few physical samples, we will fit a distribution to model the material property. This will give us the means to draw "virtual samples" and use those to estimate the POF.

### __q3__ Fit a lognormal distribution to the strength data using the `fitdistr()` function.

*Note*: In this challenge I generated the `strength` data from a `lognormal` distribution; if you didn't know that fact, then the choice of distribution would be an *additional* source of uncertainty!

*Hint 1*: We learned how to do this in `e-stat08-fit-dist`.

*Hint 2*: The `fitdistr` function uses `densfun = "lognormal"` to specify a lognormal distribution.

```{r q3-task}
## TODO:
fit <- fitdistr(df_samples$strength, densfun = "lognormal")

df_fit <- data.frame(
  distribution = "lognormal",
  mean = fit$estimate[1],
  sd = fit$estimate[2]
)
df_fit
```

Once you've successfully fit a model for the strength, you can estimate the probability of failure by drawing samples from the fitted distribution.

### __q4__ Complete the code below by 1. choosing a Monte Carlo sample size `n_monte_carlo`, 2. extracting the estimated parameters from q3, and 3. computing the limit state value `g = g_break()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint 1*: You will need to combine ideas from `c07-monte-carlo` and `e-stat08-fit-dist` in order to complete this task.

*Hint 2*: The function `rlnorm()` will allow you to draw samples from a lognormal distribution.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO 1: Choose Monte Carlo sample size
n_monte_carlo <- 1000000

## TODO 2: Extract parameter estimates from df_fit
strength_meanlog <- fit$estimate[1]
strength_sdlog <- fit$estimate[2]

# Generate samples
df_norm_sim <-
  tibble(strength = rlnorm(n_monte_carlo, strength_meanlog, strength_sdlog)) %>%
## TODO 3: Compute structural response
  mutate(g = g_break(strength))

## NOTE: The following code estimates the POF and a 95% confidence interval
df_norm_pof <-
  df_norm_sim %>%
  mutate(stat = g <= 0) %>%
  summarize(
    pof_est = mean(stat),
    se = sd(stat) / sqrt(n_monte_carlo)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pof_lo = pof_est - 1.96 * se,
    pof_hi = pof_est + 1.96 * se
  ) %>%
  mutate(pof_lo, pof_est, pof_hi)

df_norm_pof



```

- Assuming your scopus is the probability of failure `POF` defined above, does your estimate exhibit real variability, induced variability, or both?
  - The estimate of POF exhibits real variability, which is reflected in the standard error of the estimate. This variability arises due to the random nature of the Monte Carlo simulation used to estimate POF.
- Does this confidence interval imply that `POF < 0.03`?
  - We have done some pretty rigiours testing and simulations to show that we can be confident POF<0.03, but it is still an estimation, which inherently has uncertainty.
- Compare this probability with your estimate from q2; is it more or less trustworthy?
  - It is more trustworthy
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from the *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
  - No, the confidence interval above only accounts for the uncertainty in the estimate of the probability of failure arising from the finite Monte Carlo sample size. It does not account for any uncertainty arising from the fact that we are approximating the distribution of the strength with a lognormal distribution or any other assumptions we have made about the model.
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
  - Yes, the limited physical tests influences the approximation of the distribution of the strength with a lognormal distribution.
- What could you do to tighten up the confidence interval?
  - Have more physical test samples to base the monte carlo simulation on.
- Can you *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
  - With what I have, I am more confident in the conclusion that POF < 0.03. Despite the smaller sample size, 25 samples are strong enough and the original distribution appears to follow a lognormal distribution

## A different way to compute the POF
<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Monte Carlo is a *general* way to estimate probabilities, but it introduces approximation error. It turns out that, for the simple problem we're studying, we can compute the probability directly using the CDF. Note that for our structural safety problem, we have

$$\text{POF} = \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0] = \mathbb{P}[S \leq L / A] = \text{CDF}_S(L/A).$$

Since `S = rlnorm(n, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`, we can use `plnorm` to compute the probability of failure without Monte Carlo as `POF = plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`. Let's combine this idea with the fitted distribution to estimate the POF.

### __q5__ Finish the following function by computing the POF with `plnorm()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Complete the function below;
##       note that you only need to edit the TODO section

estimate_pof <- function(df) {
  ## Fit the distribution
  df_fit <-
    df %>%
    pull(strength) %>%
    fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
    tidy()

  ## Extract the parameters
  strength_meanlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "meanlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)
  strength_sdlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "sdlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)

## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure using plnorm
  pof_estimate <- plnorm(q = L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)

  ## NOTE: No need to edit; this last line returns your pof_estimate
  pof_estimate
}

## NOTE: No need to edit; test your function
df_samples %>% estimate_pof()
```

**Observations**:

- How does this estimate compare with your Monte Carlo estimate above?
  - It is very similar, the monte carlo estimate is 0.018141, this estimate is 0.01832289. This estimate is of higher precision and is slightly lower than the monte carlo estimation.
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
  - No, this estimate does not have any uncertainty due to Monte Carlo approximation because it is not based on a Monte Carlo simulation, but rather on the analytical probability distribution function of the lognormal distribution.
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo approximation* be induced or real?
  - The uncertainty due to Monte Carlo approximation in the POF would be considered induced, as it arises from the simulation process used to estimate the probability of failure.
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *limited physical tests*? Why or why not?
  - No, this estimate does not have any uncertainty due to limited physical tests because it is based on a mathematical model of the system, rather than physical testing.
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *limited physical tests* be induced or real?
  - Uncertainty due to limited physical tests would be real uncertainty, as it reflects the actual variation and lack of knowledge about the behavior of the system.

## Quantifying sampling uncertainty
<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Using `plnorm()` gets rid of Monte Carlo error, but we still have uncertainty due to limited physical testing. Often we can use a CLT approximation to construct a confidence interval. However, with `plnorm()` we can't use a CLT approximation because it does not follow the assumptions of the central limit theorem (it's not a sum of iid random variables). Instead, we can use the *bootstrap* to approximate a confidence interval via resampling.

### __q6__ The code below estimates a bootstrap CI on your POF estimate. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q6-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
tidycustom <- function(est) {tibble(term = "pof", estimate = est)}

df_samples %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(
    estimates = map(
      splits,
      ~ analysis(.x) %>% estimate_pof() %>% tidycustom()
    )
  ) %>%
  int_pctl(estimates)
```

**Observations**:

- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *Monte Carlo approximation* of the POF? Why or why not?
  - The confidence interval above accounts for the uncertainty arising from the limited physical tests (df_samples) but not for the uncertainty arising from the Monte Carlo approximation of the POF.
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
  -The confidence interval above does not account for uncertainty arising from limited physical tests (df_samples). This is because the bootstrapping method assumes that the sample is representative of the population and does not account for any bias or variability due to the limited sample size or selection.
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
  - It is not possible to confidently conclude that POF < 0.03 based on the current analysis alone. The 95% confidence interval for the POF is [0.017, 0.049], which does not exclude the possibility that the true POF is 0.03 or higher. However, the estimate and confidence interval suggest that the POF is relatively low and may warrant further investigation or mitigation.
