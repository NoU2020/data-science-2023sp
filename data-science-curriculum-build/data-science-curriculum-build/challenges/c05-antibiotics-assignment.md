Antibiotics
================
(Your name here)
2020-

*Purpose*: Creating effective data visualizations is an *iterative*
process; very rarely will the first graph you make be the most
effective. The most effective thing you can do to be successful in this
iterative process is to *try multiple graphs* of the same data.

Furthermore, judging the effectiveness of a visual is completely
dependent on *the question you are trying to answer*. A visual that is
totally ineffective for one question may be perfect for answering a
different question.

In this challenge, you will practice *iterating* on data visualization,
and will anchor the *assessment* of your visuals using two different
questions.

*Note*: Please complete your initial visual design **alone**. Work on
both of your graphs alone, and save a version to your repo *before*
coming together with your team. This way you can all bring a diversity
of ideas to the table!

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

*Background*: The data\[1\] we study in this challenge report the
[*minimum inhibitory
concentration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration)
(MIC) of three drugs for different bacteria. The smaller the MIC for a
given drug and bacteria pair, the more practical the drug is for
treating that particular bacteria. An MIC value of *at most* 0.1 is
considered necessary for treating human patients.

These data report MIC values for three antibiotics—penicillin,
streptomycin, and neomycin—on 16 bacteria. Bacteria are categorized into
a genus based on a number of features, including their resistance to
antibiotics.

# Visualization

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Prototype 5 visuals

To start, construct **5 qualitatively different visualizations of the
data** `df_antibiotics`. These **cannot** be simple variations on the
same graph; for instance, if two of your visuals could be made identical
by calling `coord_flip()`, then these are *not* qualitatively different.

For all five of the visuals, you must show information on *all 16
bacteria*. For the first two visuals, you must *show all variables*.

*Hint 1*: Try working quickly on this part; come up with a bunch of
ideas, and don’t fixate on any one idea for too long. You will have a
chance to refine later in this challenge.

*Hint 2*: The data `df_antibiotics` are in a *wide* format; it may be
helpful to `pivot_longer()` the data to make certain visuals easier to
construct.

#### Visual 1 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "antibiotics", 
    values_to = "resistance",
    c("penicillin","streptomycin", "neomycin")
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(antibiotics, resistance, color = as_factor(gram))) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~bacteria) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  guides(x =  guide_axis(angle = 90))
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.1-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 2 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "antibiotics", 
    values_to = "resistance",
    c("penicillin","streptomycin", "neomycin")
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(antibiotics, resistance, color = as_factor(bacteria))) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  guides(x =  guide_axis(angle = 90))
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.2-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 3 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "antibiotics", 
    values_to = "resistance",
    c("penicillin","streptomycin", "neomycin")
    ) %>% 

  ggplot(aes(bacteria, resistance, color = as_factor(antibiotics))) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=gram)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  guides(x =  guide_axis(angle = 90))
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.3-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 4 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
df_antibiotics %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "antibiotics", 
    values_to = "resistance",
    c("penicillin","streptomycin", "neomycin")
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bacteria, antibiotics, fill = resistance)) +
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_continuous(trans= "log10") +
  guides(x =  guide_axis(angle = 90))
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.4-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 5 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
df_antibiotics %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "antibiotics", 
    values_to = "resistance",
    c("penicillin","streptomycin", "neomycin")
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(antibiotics, resistance)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

### **q2** Assess your visuals

There are **two questions** below; use your five visuals to help answer
both Guiding Questions. Note that you must also identify which of your
five visuals were most helpful in answering the questions.

*Hint 1*: It’s possible that *none* of your visuals is effective in
answering the questions below. You may need to revise one or more of
your visuals to answer the questions below!

*Hint 2*: It’s **highly unlikely** that the same visual is the most
effective at helping answer both guiding questions. **Use this as an
opportunity to think about why this is.**

#### Guiding Question 1

> How do the three antibiotics vary in their effectiveness against
> bacteria of different genera and Gram stain?

*Observations* - What is your response to the question above? - In
general, penicillin is effective against bacteria with positive gram and
fairly ineffective against bacteria with negative gram. For the positive
gram bacteria, either neomycin or penicillin are usually
effective(effectiveness\>0.1), while steptomycin is not super effective
in general for positive grams. For negative gram bacteria, penicillin in
general is not super effective (effectiveness\>0.1), and the neomycin
and streptomycin are more effective than penicillin, but can both be
ineffective (eg aerobacter aerogenes). - Which of your visuals above (1
through 5) is **most effective** at helping to answer this question? -
The first is particularly helpful for make distinction between the
effectiveness between the different antibiotics on specific bacteria,
while graph 2 is helpful in identifying specific trends with antibiotics
and grams. - Why? - graph 1 is essentially 16 independent graphs, so
while it is hard to make comparison between individual graphs, it is
helpful in identifying how the different antibiotics vary within a
specific bacteria. graph 2 is a scatter plot and colored all the
different bacteria differently. It is not helpful is recognizing
specific bacteria because of the overlapping colors. It is helpful in
recognizing general trends with grams and antibiotics.

#### Guiding Question 2

In 1974 *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus pneumoniae*,
and in 1984 *Streptococcus fecalis* was renamed *Enterococcus fecalis*
\[2\].

> Why was *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus
> pneumoniae*?

*Observations* - What is your response to the question above? - It has
very similar behaviors to Streptococcus family bacteria in terms of high
resistance of neomycin and streptomycin but low resistance to
penicillin. - Which of your visuals above (1 through 5) is **most
effective** at helping to answer this question? - Graph 3 was the most
effective. - Why? - I could compare the effectiveness of each antibiotic
on each bacteria with relative ease and i can reference the relative
effectiveness of each antibiotic for the different bacterias. This is my
favorite graph.
